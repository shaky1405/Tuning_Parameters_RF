# Tuning_Parameters_RF
Tuning parameters in a Random Forest model involves optimizing the hyperparameters to achieve the best performance for your specific problem. Here are the key hyperparameters to consider, along with strategies for tuning them:

Key parameters:
Number of Trees (n_estimators)

This is the number of trees in the forest.
More trees generally improve performance but also increase computation time.
Maximum Depth of the Tree (max_depth)

Controls the depth of each tree.
Deeper trees can model more complex relationships but may lead to overfitting.
Minimum Samples Split (min_samples_split)

The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
Higher values prevent the model from learning overly specific patterns, reducing overfitting.
Minimum Samples Leaf (min_samples_leaf)

The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
Like min_samples_split, higher values can reduce overfitting.
Maximum Features (max_features)

The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
Can be set to a number (e.g., 5), a fraction (e.g., 0.5), or a function (e.g., "sqrt" or "log2").
Bootstrap (bootstrap)

Whether to use bootstrap samples when building trees.
If False, the whole dataset is used to build each tree.
